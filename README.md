# LoTR-App

A Flask-based web application that allows users to interact with ‘The One API’ (https://the-one-api.dev/) to retrieve information about characters and quotes from the world of J.R.R. Tolkien. This application provides a dynamic and engaging user experience by randomly selecting and displaying character details and quotes. Have fun and enjoy!
